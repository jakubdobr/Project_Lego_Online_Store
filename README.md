This project provides a detailed analysis of sales data from the website krecik.sklep.pl, focusing on LEGO products and others products. The aim of the analysis was to extract valuable insights, such as the most popular products, revenue trends over time, and order patterns, in order to make data-driven decisions.

# Technologies Used
## **Python**:
  - **Pandas**
  - **Matplotlib**
  - **Regular Expressions** 
  - **Jupyter Notebook**

# Data Analysis Process
The analysis focused on several key areas:

  1.**LEGO Orders**: Counted orders containing LEGO products based on specific patterns in product names.
  2.**Order Size**: Identified the top 10 largest orders by product count.
  3.**Revenue Analysis**: Grouped and calculated monthly revenues, both overall and specifically for LEGO products.
  4.**Product Trends**: Determined which LEGO sets were most frequently purchased, based on product codes.

#Results:
+ **Oders number**: 837
+ **Most expensive order**: 3549.92 PLN
+ **Largest product count in an order**: 15 items
+ **Average monthly earnings**: 10,020.09 PLN
+ **Average monthly earnings from LEGO sets**: 8,854.37 PLN
+ **Best month in terms of revenue**: June 2023, with total earnings of 18,399.0 PLN
+ **Best-selling LEGO sets**: LEGO 6008 and LEGO 32171, with 16 orders each
+ **Top cities for sales**: Warsaw, Wrocław, Cracow, Poznań, Łódź

#Conclusions
The analysis provided several valuable insights:

+ **Order Count**: Out of a total of 837 orders, 669 were for LEGO products. This shows that while LEGO sets are a significant source of income, other products also contribute to the website’s overall revenue.
+ **Peak Sales**: The highest revenue months occurred during winter and summer holidays, likely driven by gift purchases during Christmas and additional summer attractions for children.
+ **Popular Products**: The LEGO products with the highest order numbers were LEGO 6008 and LEGO 32171, each with 16 orders. Interestingly, LEGO 32171 is not a traditional LEGO set but a pin used to connect various structural elements.
+ **Actionable Insights**: The cities with the highest sales are Warsaw, Wrocław, and Cracow. One potential strategy to further increase sales is to enhance targeted advertising in these cities. For example, building a billboard in Warsaw could significantly expand the website's sales reach.
