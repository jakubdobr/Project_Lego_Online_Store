# LEGO_Analysis

# Project Goals
The primary objective of this project was to perform a detailed analysis of the sales data from the website krecik.sklep.pl, with a focus on LEGO products as well as other categories. By exploring the data, the analysis aimed to extract actionable insights that could guide future business decisions and optimize sales strategies. Specific goals included:

1.Understanding Sales Performance:
  - Analyze overall sales trends over time to identify peak sales periods and seasonal patterns.
  - Break down sales by product categories (LEGO and non-LEGO) to determine which types of products drive the most revenue and when.

2.Identifying Best-Selling Products:
  - Discover the most frequently purchased products, especially within the LEGO category, to understand customer preferences and identify potential best-sellers that should be prioritized.
  - Pinpoint product codes with the highest sales to help with restocking and inventory management, ensuring that the most popular products are always available.

3.Evaluating Revenue Trends:
  - Analyze monthly revenue and calculate key financial metrics, such as total revenue and average revenue per month, to assess the financial performance of the store.
  - Compare revenues generated by LEGO products against other product categories to identify how significant LEGO sets are to the overall business model.
  - Identify the best and worst months for revenue to adjust marketing efforts and promotions accordingly.

4.Order Pattern Analysis:
  - Investigate patterns in the size of customer orders, including identifying the largest orders by value and by product count, to understand customer purchasing behavior.
  - Explore whether larger orders or higher-value orders are associated with specific products or times of year.

5.City-Based Sales Insights:
  - Analyze sales by location to identify cities with the highest customer activity and sales volume. This geographic breakdown helps in targeting marketing and advertising efforts to maximize reach in top-performing cities.
  - Evaluate potential for regional marketing campaigns (e.g., billboards, targeted ads) in cities like Warsaw, Wrocław, and Cracow, where sales are the highest.

6.Supporting Business Strategy:
  - Provide insights that can guide inventory management, ensuring that the most popular products are well-stocked, especially during peak seasons such as Christmas and summer holidays.

# Technologies Used
## **Python**:
  - **Pandas**
    - Pandas was employed for data manipulation and analysis. It was particularly useful in cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and performing aggregations. Pandas' groupby() function was extensively used to          calculate monthly revenues and summarize data such as the most frequently ordered products.
    -**Example tasks included:**:
    -  Loading the dataset from a CSV file and exploring its structure using functions like pd.read_csv() and df.describe().
    -  Cleaning and transforming product names using string manipulation and regular expressions.
    -  Aggregating data to calculate total monthly revenue and the number of orders containing LEGO products.

  - **Matplotlib**
    - Matplotlib was used to create visualizations that helped uncover trends in the data. Line plots were generated to track monthly revenue changes, while bar charts highlighted the most popular products and cities            contributing to sales.
    - Visualizations helped to make the analysis more interpretable and actionable, allowing for the identification of seasonal trends and best-selling products.
    - Specific plots included:
      - Monthly revenue trends for both overall sales and LEGO-specific sales.
      - Top 10 products by number of orders and total revenue.
      
  - **Regular Expressions (regex)** 
    - Regular expressions were used to identify orders containing LEGO products by searching for specific patterns in product names. This was necessary because some product names were inconsistent, and regular expressions       provided a powerful way to detect LEGO-related items based on key terms such as “LEGO” or certain product codes.
    - Regex allowed for efficient filtering of the data, ensuring that only relevant rows (i.e., orders containing LEGO products) were analyzed for specific insights.

  - **Jupyter Notebook**
    - Jupyter Notebook was the main environment for conducting the analysis. It provided an interactive platform to write code, visualize data, and document the analysis process in real-time.
    - Jupyter's ability to combine code execution with markdown allowed for a seamless integration of code snippets, charts, and explanations, making the analysis easier to follow.
    - It was particularly useful for iteratively refining the analysis and quickly testing different approaches to data manipulation and visualization.

# Data Analysis Process
The analysis focused on several key areas:

  1.**LEGO Orders**: Counted orders containing LEGO products based on specific patterns in product names.
  2.**Order Size**: Identified the top 10 largest orders by product count.
  3.**Revenue Analysis**: Grouped and calculated monthly revenues, both overall and specifically for LEGO products.
  4.**Product Trends**: Determined which LEGO sets were most frequently purchased, based on product codes.

# Results:
The analysis revealed several important insights into the sales performance of krecik.sklep.pl, particularly focusing on LEGO products. Below is a summary of the key findings:
1. ## Overall Sales and Order Insights:
  - **Total number of orders**: 837 orders were processed over the analyzed period (January 2023 to December 2023).
  - **Orders containing LEGO products**: 669 orders (approximately 80% of total orders) included at least one LEGO product, indicating the significant contribution of LEGO sales to overall revenue.
  - **Most expensive order**: 3,549.92 PLN. This high-value order demonstrates the potential for premium purchases, suggesting that some customers are willing to make substantial investments in LEGO sets.
  - **Largest order by product count**: The largest order contained 15 items, showing that some customers tend to purchase multiple products in a single transaction.
2.## Revenue Analysis:
  - **Average monthly revenue**: 10,020.09 PLN. This figure represents the average earnings across all product categories, providing a baseline for expected monthly performance.
  - **Average monthly revenue from LEGO sets**: 8,854.37 PLN. LEGO products accounted for a significant majority (approximately 88%) of monthly revenue, emphasizing their importance in the overall product offering.
  - **Best month in terms of total revenue**: June 2023 was the highest-earning month, with a total revenue of 18,399.00 PLN. This suggests that mid-year promotions or events (such as school vacations or Father’s Day) may      drive increased sales.
3. ## Top-Selling Products:
  - **Best-selling LEGO sets**: The LEGO 6008 and LEGO 32171 models were the most frequently purchased, each with 16 orders. Interestingly, LEGO 32171 is not a traditional LEGO set but a pin used to connect various             structural     elements, indicating that smaller, functional components also contribute significantly to overall sales.
  - These results highlight the need to ensure a constant supply of both popular sets and smaller accessory pieces, which customers often purchase to complement larger sets.
4. ## Geographic Sales Insights:
    - **Top cities for sales**: Warsaw, Wrocław, Cracow, Poznań, and Łódź were the top 5 cities in terms of sales volume, with Warsaw leading the way. This suggests a concentration of customers in major urban areas,       
     potentially offering opportunities for region-specific marketing campaigns or localized promotions.
5. ## Seasonal Trends:
  - **Peak sales periods**: The analysis identified two primary sales peaks – during the winter holiday season (driven by Christmas shopping) and the summer vacation period. These trends suggest that targeted promotions  
   during these times could further boost sales.
  - **Revenue dips**: The lowest revenue months occurred in early spring (March and April), which may provide an opportunity for seasonal discounts or marketing campaigns to encourage purchases during slower periods.
    
# Summary of Key Insights:
  - **LEGO's Dominance**: With approximately 80% of all orders containing LEGO products, it's clear that LEGO sets are the driving force behind the store’s revenue. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining a wide    
    selection and competitive pricing for these products.
  - **Seasonal Strategies**: The data suggest that sales are highly influenced by seasonal trends, with significant peaks during winter holidays and summer months. Tailored promotions and advertising campaigns during     
     these 
  periods could maximize revenue potential.
  - **Product Popularity**: While popular LEGO sets dominate, small functional pieces like LEGO 32171 also contribute significantly to sales. This opens up opportunities to promote and stock up on smaller, complementary 
    items 
  that customers might purchase alongside larger sets.
  - **Geographic Focus**: The majority of sales come from large urban centers such as Warsaw and Wrocław. Expanding marketing efforts in these areas—through digital marketing, local ads, or even billboard campaigns—could 
  further increase sales and brand visibility.
